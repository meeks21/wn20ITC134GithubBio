Hello my name is Kemar meeks, and I am an aspiring web developer. Currently I am a student at Seattle Central College, and am in my first semester of there web development program. My path into IT has not been so straight forward. Previously I received a Bachelor's degree in Political Science from the University, of South Florida. After graduation I worked in marketing for a few years and quickly realized that it was not something that I enjoyed, and so I decided I needed to move on. I have always had a passion for technology, and fascination with computers so i figured that I should pursue that path . So after some careful consideration and figuring out the best and most cost effective course of action I moved to Seattle, a city with a large tech industry, and I enrolled at Seattle Central College in order to reach my goal of becoming a web developer.
